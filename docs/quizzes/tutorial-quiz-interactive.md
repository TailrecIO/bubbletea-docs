# Interactive Quiz Explained

An Interactive Quiz is a game-style quiz where all participants progress through the quiz at the same pace. Each participant completes the same question one at a time until the quiz concludes. At the end of each question, quiz participants may view the leaderboard, which displays the top five users with the highest scores. This type of quiz is suitable for ice-breaking activities like trivia games, birthday party games (where questions may be about the birthday person), or competitive games where participants vie for rewards.

When creating a quiz for the first time, you must specify the quiz type. In [the Quiz Authoring tutorial](tutorial-quiz-authoring.md), we selected the **Interactive** type. If you followed the tutorial in order, there's no need to change anything. However, if you deviated from the tutorial sequence, please edit the quiz and change the type to **Interactive** before proceeding.

## Starting a New Session

A quiz session is the event during which participants can take part in the quiz. In an interactive quiz, it's important to ensure that all participants are online and ready to take the quiz, with you acting as the moderator. The interactive quiz will occur in the specified Slack channel, whether it's a private or public channel. For private channels, please ensure that the bot is added to the channel before proceeding to avoid permission errors.

You can initiate a quiz session directly from the quiz home tab, the quiz builder interface, or in any channel using the slash command `/quiz` or `/myquiz`
