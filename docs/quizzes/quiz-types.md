# Quiz Types

Currently, there are two types of quizzes that you can create, and you can change the quiz type at any time. 
The only thing affected by this change is your future quiz sessions. Feel free to explore, as you can change your mind at any time.

## Interactive Quiz

This quiz type resembles Kahoot!, where all participants must respond to the same question within the time limit (if applicable).
Essentially, everyone progresses at the same pace, creating a competitive game-like atmosphere. 
If a time limit isn't specified, the quiz moderator must manually click "Next" to proceed to the next question


## Standard Quiz

This quiz type is designed for a traditional setting where participants can proceed at their own pace, akin to a paper quiz 
where each individual has their own copy. Your answers are private, and you have the freedom to skip questions and 
return to them later, or even opt not to start the quiz at all. The quiz moderator may set a deadline for completion, 
requiring participants to finish before it expires for their answers to be accepted. Various configurations set by the 
quiz moderator determine the actions participants can and cannot take.
